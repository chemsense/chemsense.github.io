		<ul> <li>03/25/2025:  Our group received an FAU Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) to support undergraduate student Franky Petion in continuing his research in the summer of 2025. </li> <br />
		
		<li>02/24/2025:  Our second paper in the series on ionophore-based electrolyte SERS sensing, titled <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400525002990?casa_token=GbuSrgwpBScAAAAA:bXxgzMkkW3wA78ryTQm0hqUOrMS-RuiSGoJDuhTpQvljlA0WIAQgvgkl1MMHyjWkS2wVPfl7PQ"> "Development of a MXene-AgNPs-Based SERS Platform for Ionophore-Based Ion-Selective Detection'"</a> has been published in Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical.</li> <br />
		
		<li>1/28/2025:  We are grateful to have received the FAU Research Cores Internal Pilot (RCIP) Award for our proposal focusing on optode-based nano sensor development. </li> <br />
		
		<li>1/23/2025:  Congratulations to Riad Rustamov on receiving the FAU Undergraduate Research Grant to continue his research on ultrasensitive ion detection with our group. </li> <br />
		
		 <li>12/11/2024:  Our paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405580824002632?via%3Dihub">"Spectroscopic and calorimetric study of the interaction between Nile Blue and double-stranded RNA"</a>  has been accepted in Biochemistry and Biophysics Reports.  </li> <br />By combining detailed experimental approaches and mechanistic insights, this study addresses the largely overlooked binding interactions of Nile Blue with dsRNA and establishes a framework for future investigations into RNA-ligand interactions.</li> <br />
